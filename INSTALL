Place a copy of the video_conversion_script.sh in an executable path such
as ~/bin

Usage: video_conversion_script.sh <input-file>

Prerequisites:

The script utilises ffmpeg and ffmpeg2theora which should be available from
distro's repo. If not, or the provided ffmpeg wasn't built with the required
encoder support then ffmpeg source can be found at:

http://ffmpeg.org/download.html

For Android and Apple devices:

./configure it with --enable-libx264 included.

x264 encoder can be found in distro's repo or at:

http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html

It utilises ffmpeg preset files as well. If ffmpeg was unable to find them,
then easiest is to copy them to ~/.ffmpeg. Else set the path accordingly as
documented at: http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-doc.html#SEC13

ffmpeg2theora source can be found at:

http://v2v.cc/~j/ffmpeg2theora/download.html

For WebM:

./configure it with --enable-libvpx --enable-libvorbis included.

libvpx source can be found at:

http://code.google.com/p/webm/downloads/list

libvorbis source can be found at:

http://www.xiph.org/downloads/

libvorbis required libogg which is available at the same location.

For MP3 Audio:

./configure it with --enable-libmp3lame included.

libmp3lame source can be found at:

http://lame.sourceforge.net/
